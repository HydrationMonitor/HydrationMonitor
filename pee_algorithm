Physiologist Sharon E. Griffin estimates that:

nearly 75% of Americans
in medical terms, are chronically dehyrdated 

you need a half ounce of fluid per day for every pound of body weight. 
for example, if you weigh 160 lbs., you need 80 oz. 
divide that by eight to calculate the number of cups you need 
which in this case is 10
she also notes that you need .034 oz. of water for every calorie you ingest
so if you ingest 3000 calroies
you need 102 oz, or 13 cups of water daily
and if you ingest 1500 calories a day 
you need 51 oz (equiv to 7 cups daily)
take the body weight versus the calorie estimate and choose the larger
this is your recommended daily water intake base
means that most people in the U.S are functioning in a chronic state of dehydration
water intake should moderately increase after a large meal
and increase more after strenuous exercise 
or extended periods in the sun
note that females should not inherenetly drink any less water than males
a 135 lb female should generally drink the same amount of water as a 135 lb male 

let x = the weight of a person
let y = the sweat level of the person
let z = the calories eaten daily by a person
let q = the number of times a person should pee daily 

x (weight) will be run through a forumla that outputs the base number of cups per day  
y (sweat) will be measured by a scale that converts to a numeric score 
z (calories) will be a number that is converted into a daily cup increment or decrement
q (pee) a final number, normally ranging from 7-15 times daily is output 

sweat level is decided as follows:
extremely low -> 0
low -> + 1
medium -> +4 
high -> +7
very high -> +9
sweat master -> 10+ (unlimited) 

the equation is: (x OR z) + y = q/2

x is (.5 * weight)/8 
z is (.034 * calories)
y is (sweat 0 - 10+)
q is (x OR z plus y) over 2

example:
130 pound person
eats 2300 calories daily
sweat level is medium
should drink (8.75 OR 9.775) + 4 cups of water daily
round up to 14 cups of water daily 
and should pee 14/2 times daily
7 pees per day

we need users to input weight, calories, and activity level
users can also customize their personal reccomendation 
users get a badge for hitting 13 daily pees 
all users are notified of possible medical concerns when they reach 14 daily pees
