# Mission/Problem Statement: 

Without advanced hydrolysis tools, there is only one reliable method to measuring/monitoring personal hydration levels: the number of times you pee per day. The app market currently lacks a simple and efficient way to monitor personal hydration, and this application serves as a simple yet powerful solution to a very important issue. Personal hydration is the single most important factor in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Some sources will recommend how much water to drink per day, but this is relatively inaccurate, as people’s bodies are extremely different, and factors such as temperature and daily activity  render it nearly impossible to precisely advise how much liquid to intake to stay healthy. However, there is one way to recommend how much water to drink: just enough to pee a regular number of times per day, every day. Hydration Monitor.

#### Problem
This should be a refinement to the problem statement you wrote for Deliverable #1. 
A good problem description is a logical, substantiated argument that proves the existence of a problem. 
Your problem description should cite evidence from your user research as well as any scholarly literature you can find about the problem.
This doesn't need to be long; a few paragraphs is usually enough to clearly define the problem you're solving.

  times you pee per day. The app market currently lacks a simple and efficient way to monitor personal hydration, and this application
  will serve as a simple yet powerful solution to a very important issue. Personal hydration is the single most important factor in maintaining
  a healthy lifestyle. Some sources will recommend how much water to drink per day, but this is relatively inaccurate, as people’s
  bodies are extremely different, and factors such as temperature and daily activity render it nearly impossible to precisely advise how

  of times per day, every day. Hydration Monitor.

#### Solution
What’s your solution to the problem? What are you going to build?

  We will design and build an application for use on any iOS system. The app will be simple to use. It will first ask the user to input his
  gender, height, weight, and age. Then, all the user has to do is remember to go on the app every time he uses the bathroom and simply
  click on the toilet icon. If the user forgets, he should just do it as soon as he remembers. Based on their basic information, the
  software will reccomend an estimated range of the number of times per day the user should pee. The user will then go through a three
  day "trial period", where he makes sure to drink enough water to feel completely hydrated, and aims for the personal reccomended range
  of pees per day. After this trial period, the software will average the numbers from the three days, and find your optimum number of
  pees per day. After this, the app can be used as a daily counter, just to help you keep track.
  If time permits, we could add extra functionality to our app, and have it notify you if you are not on track for meeting your daily pee
  goal. For example, if you are supposed to pee seven times, and you have only gone twice by 3pm, the app will notify you to drink more 
  water.

#### Process
How will you apply agile methods to build it? 

  We will have scrums multiple times per week, and discuss what kind of progress we have made since our last scrum meeting.
  There is a scrum folder in our repo for us to track our backlog, as well as any other info pertaining to our scrum meetings.
  We will be open to change in design and keep our code maintainable & allow features to be easily added.
