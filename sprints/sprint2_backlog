For the next customer demo, we want to have the following functionality completed:

1. The first page of the wireframe running on an emulator in android studio
  - A clickable icon in the center of the screen
  - A counter at the bottom of the screen 
  - A space for ads at the top of the screen 
  - An attractive background 

There will not be specifically assigned roles for this sprint, we are going to take a group approach to all of these tasks.
