It's time to solve the problem you identified in Deliverable #1. Your task for this homework assignment is to design a solution and describe to me how you will apply agile methods to build it. 
This deliverable will be a document with three sections:

Problem. This should be a refinement to the problem statement you wrote for Deliverable #1. A good problem description is a logical, substantiated argument that proves the existence of a problem. Your problem description should cite evidence from your user research as well as any scholarly literature you can find about the problem. This doesn't need to be long; a few paragraphs is usually enough to clearly define the problem you're solving.

Solution.  What’s your solution to the problem? What are you going to build?

Process. How will you apply agile methods to build it? 

Write this deliverable in a Markdown document in your repository's wiki.

Note that you have a limited amount of time to do this. That means that your design really can't be that complicated from an interactive perspective. Keep your solution simple. Our focus in this class will be on something that is architected well, defect-free, and shipping, not something that is multifaceted and powerful.
