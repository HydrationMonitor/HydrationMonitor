We discussed implementing our app first as an iOS app running off of Firebase.
Our goal is to get a Hello World going within the week. 

While the engineering is working on that, other team members will work on
finalizing the design and requirements for HydrationMonitor. Within the week,
we should have a very solid idea as to what our app's structure will be (in
terms of screens, what info we need, etc.)
