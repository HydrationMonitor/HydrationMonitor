Problem. This should be a refinement to the problem statement you wrote for Deliverable #1. 
A good problem description is a logical, substantiated argument that proves the existence of a problem. 
Your problem description should cite evidence from your user research as well as any scholarly literature you can find about the problem.
This doesn't need to be long; a few paragraphs is usually enough to clearly define the problem you're solving.

Solution.  Whatâ€™s your solution to the problem? What are you going to build?

Process. How will you apply agile methods to build it? 

  We will have scrums multiple times per week, and discuss what kind of progress we have made since our last scrum meeting.
  There is a scrum folder in our repo for us to track our backlog, as well as any other info pertaining to our scrum meetings.
  We will be open to change in design and keep our code maintainable & allow features to be easily added.
